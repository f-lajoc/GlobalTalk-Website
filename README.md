## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Media query

### Thoughts & Troubles

- Had a mini hiccup with font awesome with it not displaying but i solved this problem by checking my previous documentation of what problem i had with font awesome in my previous project and i went straight to reading font awesome CDN Documentation where i got the latest fa -[<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-iecdLmaskl7CVkqkXNQ/ZH/XLlvWZOJyj7Yy7tcenmpD1ypASozpmT/E0iPtmFIB46ZmdtAc9eNBvH0H/ZpiBw==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />].

- The design was only given in desktop view and i tweaked it to making its mobile view responsiveness 

- This project took me about 24hrs to build using my mobile phone

- I reached out to Floki after checking her portfolio [http://floki.disha.page], a UI/UX designer from MLSA OAU COMMUNITY to try and build one of her designs[The ANIME NFT LANDING PAGE] that i want to challenge myself with after exam and she agreedðŸ¤¸

### What I learned and used

- I got to know there's a new font awesome version.

- I learnt vertical-align property with value: middle could make my checkbox on the same line with the label

From the knowledge I have, i used

- Flexbox which I'm getting better using
- Media query
- Css display propery to only display at desktop view 

### Continued development

I should learn some CSS part I'm yet to master side by side with JavaScript 
- Grid
- Transition
- Animation
- Bootstrap 
Hopefully Tailwind CSS
